     <p class="paragraph"><h3>Our mission is to create a working cross platform mobile and web application that allows building administrators to change the status of their lights. Users will also be able to see a live update of how much energy is being consumed by each particular room that they are in charge of. Owners of different stores will have status reports and functionality in only the stores that they themselves own. By creating this application, we plan on helping out Store managers in staying environmentally conscious by letting them see where they are losing energy and give them a chance to change those habits in the long run.</h3></p>
